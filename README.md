## ðŸ“– Abstract
We introduce an efficient and versatile quantum teleportation protocol for specific types of *n*-qubit entangled states. By employing a partially entangled Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state as the quantum channel and an optimal Positive Operator-Valued Measure (POVM) based on an improved reciprocal state formulation, we achieve unambiguous state discrimination. The scheme has been generalized to support various entangled state configurations and demonstrates a notable reduction in classical communication costs for these states compared to standard Bell-basis teleportation. Its capacity for integration with conventional protocols is pivotal, enhancing quantum hop-by-hop communication security by allowing strategic choices in quantum channel and teleportation strategy.
